# Indicators

Implementation, visualization, back-testing, and real-time integration of indicators and strategies used in day trading.

### Implementation

* All the indicators and the trading strategies surrounding the indicators are developed and implemented in their respective folders.  

### Visualization

* The indicators and the result of their algorithms are plotted and visualized on a graph (including decisions to *buy*, *sell*, etc.)  

### Back-Testing

* The strategies are tested on historical (or recent) data and their results are stored and visualized.

### Real-time integration

* The algorithms are integrated into a real-time broker platform using their API (either simulation or actual account).
